The scoring formula for the majority of implementations of Tetris is built on the belief that more difficult line clears should be awarded
more points. In Nintendo's implementations on the NES, Game Boy, and SNES, the four possible line clears are as follows:

   1. Single = (level+1)*40 one line is cleared.
   2. Double = (level+1)*100 two lines are simultaneously cleared.
   3. Triple = (level+1)*300 three lines are simultaneously cleared.
   4. Tetris = (level+1)*1200 four lines are simultaneously cleared.

Level 	00 		01 		02 		03 		04 		05 		06 		07 		08 		09 		10
Single 	40 		80 		120 	160 	200 	240 	280 	320 	360 	400 	440
Double 	100 	200 	300 	400 	500 	600 	700 	800 	900 	1000 	1100
Triple 	300 	600 	900 	1200 	1500 	1800 	2100 	2400 	2700 	3000 	3300
Tetris 	1200 	2400 	3600 	4800 	6000 	7200 	8400 	9600 	10800 	12000 	13200

On most implementations, players may press a button to accelerate the current piece's descent, rather than waiting for it to fall.
When a player locks a piece in this way, many such versions award a number of points based on the height the piece fell before locking.
If a piece is manually dropped x lines and locked before the button is released, these versions will typically award either x points,
or (level + 1)*x points. If a piece is not accelerated at all the player will gain no points for that piece unless a line is made.
